## Introduction
It is a mini-project that uses satellite data to segment the forest fire area in the image.
This repo contains the implementation of a fire region segmentation method using the U-Net model structure.

## Training
Run the following command to train the proposed fire segmentation model on fire segmentation training dataset.
```
python train.py
```

## Test
Run the following command to train the proposed fire segmentation model on fire segmentation test dataset.
```
python test.py
```

## Performance results
